                Separating mixtures of compounds by passing them through some other substance - the stationary phase.<br>
                The compounds move at different speeds in the mobile phase and become separated from each other<br>

                <h3>Paper Chromatography</h3>
                The solid that the mixture has to pass along is paper (stationary phase).<br>
                The mixture moves (is dragged along) by a solvent (mobile phase) passing along the paper 
                by capillary action. <br>
